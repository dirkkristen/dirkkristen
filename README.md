- 👋 Hi, I’m @dirkkristen
- 👀 I’m interested in ... simplicity and minimalism... world domination and sleep
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... that I have a lot to learn, but - mainly, task automation and ecommerce V. the year 3000, API's and streamlining everything, including streamliners...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... a way to ensure spiders never fly.
- 📫 How to reach me ... is something I doub't really anything anyone would want to do for any reason, unless something I happen to be posessing which I have not disclosed (nor aware), in a unique and majestikally (yes) strong positiion and unexpected experience... background/skillset, oh yes. Long and the short - you got this! (you, not me).
